skyCatalogs_creator: creates simulated object catalogs
=======================================================
skyCatalogs_creator creates simulated object catalogs from precursor catalogs.
For an API providing access to these simulated object catalogs see the
package [skyCatalogs](https://github.com/skyCatalogs/)
These catalogs may be used as inputs to image simulation (originally
only for the Rubin Observatory; since also used in simulations for the
Roman Observatory) and as truth catalogs.

This documentation covers installation and usage instructions for the package.

The source code of *skyCatalogscreator* is hosted at
