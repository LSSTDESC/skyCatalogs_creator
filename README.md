# The skyCatalogs_creator package

This package contains code to create sky catalogs from input like cosmoDC2 (for galaxies) and similar catalogs for other source types


Sky Catalogs are chiefly intended for use by simulation programs. The physical representation is meant to compactly represent information needed to compute fluxes at a given time, under specified conditions (e.g. band).

See also documentation for the [skyCatalogs package](https://lsstdesc.org/skyCaalaogs/), which provides an API for accessing the catalog files.
